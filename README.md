# Mapping South African Estuaries
This project gives a summary of 62 of the major estuaries in South Africa. Python and its pandas library was utilized for the task of data munging web scrapped data. Custom     python code was written to do coordinate format conversion, from degrees, minutes, seconds (DMS) to decimal degrees (DD). The Folium and GeoPandas libraries were used to make maps of the geospatial data of the estuaries in South Africa. Also, a brief exploratory data analysis is included in the project. A geospatial analysis project of some major South African estuaries.
